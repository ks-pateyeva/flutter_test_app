The pendulum of the title refers to an actual pendulum designed by French physicist Léon Foucault to demonstrate Earth's rotation, which has symbolic significance within the novel. Some believe that it refers to Michel Foucault, noting Eco's friendship with the French philosopher, but the author specifically rejects any intentional reference to Michel Foucault—this is regarded as one of his subtle literary jokes.",
